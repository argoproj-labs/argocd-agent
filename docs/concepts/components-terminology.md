# Components and terminology

This chapter introduces the reader to the components of *argocd-agent* and its terminology.

## Control plane cluster

The *control plane* or *control plane cluster* is the heart of the architecture. It holds all configuration, is responsible for distributing the configuration among [agents](#agent) and it hosts all central components used for observability and management. At the minimum, this cluster will host the *argocd-agent*'s [principal](#principal) component and the Argo CD API server, including the Argo CD web UI.

The control plane cluster itself will not perform reconciliation of Argo CD `Applications` to any cluster, including itself.

Typically, there exists only one control plane cluster in any given setup.

The control plane cluster is sometimes called the *hub*.

## Workload cluster

A *workload cluster* is a cluster that is the target for applications. In the classical Argo CD architecture, a workload cluster is one that you connect your Argo CD installation to, i.e. using `argocd cluster add` or its declarative equivalent. 

In the case of *argocd-agent*, the workload cluster will host at least the *argocd-agent*'s [agent](#agent) component and Argo CD's application controller for local reconciliation. In a nutshell, each workload cluster needs to have a low footprint version of Argo CD installed to it.

The workload cluster is sometimes called a *spoke*.

## Principal

The *principal* is a central component of *argocd-agent*. It runs on the control plane cluster, and its main tasks are to distribute configuration and receive status information from and to the [agents](#agent), respectively.

*Agents* need to be registered with the *principal*, and the *principal* will authenticate agents once they connect.

The *principal* provides additional services to the Argo CD API server, so that users will be able to view live resources and container logs from workload clusters.

The *principal* typically requires a limited set of privileges on the control plane cluster.

## Agent

The *agent* is a component that gets installed to each workload cluster. It will be configured to connect to a specific *principal*, from which it will receive all configuration and to which it will send status updates.

Depending on the features an *agent* should provide, it will require limited to extended set of privileges on the workload cluster.

Each *agent* can run in one of the following modes: *managed* or *autonomous*. For more information, refer to the chapter about [agent modes](./agent-modes/index.md).
