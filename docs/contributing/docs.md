# Docs contributions

There are only a couple of rules (or kind asks) for contributions to documentation:

## General

* Please use a spell checker for contributions to the docs. We recommend [cspell](https://cspell.org/), which also has a plugin for VS Code.
* Please be mindful of the language you use.

## Typo and grammar fixes

We appreciate people submitting PRs to fix typos and grammar.

## Corrections

Sometimes, the documentation is outdated, missing some important piece of information or plain wrong. Please feel free to submit PRs to correct these kind of bugs.

## Translations

At this point in time, we do not have the capacity to handle translated documentation. We kindly ask to keep all submissions in the English language.
