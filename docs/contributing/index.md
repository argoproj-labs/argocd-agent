# Contributing to argocd-agent

## Preface

*argocd-agent* is a community-driven Open Source project, published under the liberal Apache-2.0 license.

The project lives from the contributions of its community, and everybody is invited to contribute to it and to become part of its community.

Contributions can come in many forms, for example, but not limited to:

* Contributing code to implement new features or fix existing bugs,
* Contributing documentation, so the project becomes easier to use for everyone,
* Taking part in technical discussions, so the project becomes better,
* Raising bug reports or feature requests
* Review other people's PRs
* Triage and participate in bug resolution
* Engage with the community to discuss use cases, issues, etc

To keep the project focused and on track, all contributions must adhere to a set of simple rules in order to be accepted. This ensures that everyone's time is used efficientlyâ€”both for potential contributors whose submissions may be rejected, and for reviewers and maintainers involved in the process.

A pre-requisite for all existing and would-be contributors is to abide by the Argo project's code of conduct. In general that means: Please be kind to each other and keep things focused, constructive and on-topic.

This chapter of the documentation will guide any contributor, whether brand new to the project or a seasoned veteran, to make a good contribution to the project.
