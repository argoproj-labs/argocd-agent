# argocd-agent - Multi-cluster agent for Argo CD

**Distributed GitOps at Scale**

argocd-agent reimagines multi-cluster GitOps by flipping the traditional architecture on its head. Instead of a central control plane struggling to reach out to hundreds of remote clusters, lightweight agents establish secure connections back to a unified hub. This fundamental shift unlocks GitOps deployment patterns that were previously impossible or impractical.

## The Challenge

Traditional Argo CD multi-cluster deployments face inherent limitations as they scale:

- **Network Complexity**: Control planes must maintain direct connections to every managed cluster
- **Security Boundaries**: Clusters behind NATs, firewalls, or in air-gapped environments are difficult to reach
- **Operational Overhead**: Complex sharding, credential management, and network troubleshooting
- **Single Points of Failure**: Centralized application controllers create bottlenecks and reliability risks

These challenges become exponentially more complex when managing dozens or hundreds of clusters across different networks, cloud providers, and security domains.

## The Solution

argocd-agent introduces a **pull-based architecture** where agents on workload clusters initiate connections to a central control plane. This inversion eliminates most traditional multi-cluster pain points while preserving the familiar Argo CD experience.

**Key Principles:**

- **Agents Connect Inward**: No outbound connections from the control plane
- **Local Reconciliation**: Application controllers run where workloads live
- **Unified Observability**: Single pane of glass for all clusters and applications
- **Standard Argo CD**: Works with vanilla Argo CD installations

See our [Features Overview](./features/index.md) for detailed capabilities and current limitations.

## Project Status

argocd-agent is a **young project in active development**. While not yet production-ready, it already demonstrates the viability of distributed GitOps at scale. The core architecture is stable, and essential features like application synchronization, live resource access, and dual operational modes are working.

**We Need Your Help**

This project thrives on community involvement. Whether you're a GitOps veteran or just curious about distributed architectures, there are many ways to contribute:

- **Test and Experiment**: Try argocd-agent in development environments and share your experience
- **Report Issues**: Help us identify bugs, edge cases, and missing features  
- **Contribute Code**: Implement new features, fix bugs, or improve performance
- **Improve Documentation**: Help make complex concepts more accessible
- **Share Use Cases**: Tell us about your multi-cluster challenges and requirements

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps shape the future of distributed GitOps.
