# Overview

## About argocd-agent

The argocd-agent project seeks to enhance the multi-cluster functionality of the popular open-source GitOps tool Argo CD by introducing an agent-based architecture for managing resources across remote clusters.

Its primary goals are to improve scalability and security as Argo CD expands beyond just a few clusters, while maintaining the features that users love: ease of use, centralized management, and observability.

Although the argocd-agent project is still in its early stages and not yet stable, everyone is encouraged to try it out, test it, and contribute.
