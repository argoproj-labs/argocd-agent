**Scale Argo CD across hundreds of clusters with a single pane of glass** 🌐

Imagine managing GitOps deployments across edge locations, multiple cloud providers, air-gapped environments, and remote sites—all from one central dashboard. argocd-agent makes this reality by extending Argo CD with a distributed architecture that brings the control plane to you, no matter where your workloads live.

## 🚀 Why argocd-agent?

**The Challenge**: Traditional multi-cluster Argo CD setups hit walls when scaling to hundreds of clusters, especially across unreliable networks, air-gapped environments, or edge locations.

**The Solution**: argocd-agent flips the script—instead of your control plane reaching out to remote clusters, lightweight agents reach back to a central hub. This "pull model" enables:

✅ **Massive Scale**: Manage thousands of applications across hundreds of clusters  
✅ **Network Resilience**: Works with intermittent connections, high latency, or restricted networks  
✅ **Edge-Friendly**: Perfect for IoT, retail, manufacturing, or remote deployments  
✅ **Air-Gap Ready**: Secure deployments that never expose cluster internals  
✅ **Cloud Agnostic**: Seamlessly span AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premises, and hybrid environments  

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **🏭 Manufacturing**: Deploy to factory floors and remote facilities
- **🛒 Retail**: Manage point-of-sale and in-store systems across locations  
- **🚢 Edge Computing**: IoT deployments, autonomous vehicles, ships, and remote sites
- **🏛️ Enterprise**: Multi-datacenter deployments with strict security requirements
- **☁️ Multi-Cloud**: Unified GitOps across different cloud providers
- **🔒 Air-Gapped**: Secure environments with restricted network access

## ⚡ Quick Start

## 🏗️ How It Works

Think of argocd-agent as a **hub-and-spoke architecture** where agents reach back to the control plane:

```
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  Control Plane  │  ← Your Argo CD UI and API
    │   (The Hub)     │     (No outbound connections needed!)
    └─────────────────┘
              ▲ ▲ ▲
              │ │ │
              │ │ │
┌─────────────┘ │ └─────────────┐
│               │               │
│               │               │
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Agent 1 │ │ Agent 2 │ │ Agent N │  ← Each agent connects independently
│ AWS     │ │ Factory │ │ Edge    │     (Pull model - no inter-agent links!)
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

**🎛️ Control Plane**: Your familiar Argo CD interface—manage everything from one place  
**🤖 Agents**: Lightweight components that reach out and connect to the hub  
**🔄 Smart Sync**: Agents pull configuration and push status updates automatically  

### Two Flavors, One Experience

**🎯 Managed Mode**: Perfect for centralized control  
- Deploy applications from your control plane to remote clusters
- Ideal for rolling out updates, managing configurations, and maintaining consistency

**🦾 Autonomous Mode**: Built for independence  
- Remote clusters manage their own applications (via GitOps)
- Control plane provides observability and monitoring
- Perfect for air-gapped or highly autonomous environments

Mix and match modes across your fleet - some clusters managed, others autonomous, all visible from one dashboard.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛡️ **Security First**
- **mTLS everywhere**: All communications are encrypted and authenticated
- **Zero trust**: Control plane never needs direct cluster access
- **Certificate-based auth**: Strong identity verification for every agent

### 🌐 **Network Resilient**
- **Intermittent connections**: Agents work offline and sync when possible
- **High latency tolerant**: Designed for satellite links, cellular, and unreliable networks
- **HTTP/1.1 compatible**: Works through corporate proxies and legacy infrastructure

### 📊 **Unified Observability**
- **Single pane of glass**: See all clusters, applications, and deployments in one view
- **Real-time status**: Health, sync status, and metrics from all environments
- **Live resources**: Inspect Kubernetes resources across your entire fleet

### ⚙️ **Operationally Friendly**
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint on remote clusters
- **Self-healing**: Agents automatically reconnect and recover
- **Easy upgrades**: Rolling updates without downtime
